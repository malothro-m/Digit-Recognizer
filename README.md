# Multi-Digit Handwritten Number Recognition with CRNN

This repository contains a deep learning implementation of **multi-digit handwritten number recognition** using a **Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network (CRNN)**. The model is built using **TensorFlow** and **Keras**, leveraging a **CNN (Convolutional Neural Network)** as an encoder and **Bidirectional LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)** as a decoder, trained on the **MNIST dataset**. 

### Project Overview

The goal of this project is to develop a deep learning model capable of recognizing sequences of digits (e.g., multi-digit numbers) from a single image. The model uses the **Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC)** loss function to train the network on sequential data, where the alignment between the input (image) and the output (digits) is unknown. This is particularly useful for handwriting recognition, where the length of the sequence and the exact alignment of the digits in the image can vary.

### Key Features

- **CRNN Architecture**: A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) extracts spatial features from the input images, and Bidirectional LSTMs (Bi-LSTMs) are used to model the sequence information, allowing the network to predict multiple digits at once.
  
- **CTC Loss**: The model is trained using **CTC loss**, a popular loss function for sequence-to-sequence tasks where the alignment between input and output is unknown. This makes it ideal for handwriting recognition where the sequence of digits must be predicted directly from the image.

- **Multi-Digit Recognition**: The model can predict sequences of digits (such as "123") from a single image, making it suitable for tasks like automatic number plate recognition (ANPR) or reading multi-digit handwritten numbers.

- **Data Augmentation**: Real-time augmentation techniques such as rotation, zoom, and shifts help increase the robustness of the model by training on more diverse variations of the data, improving its generalization on unseen test data.

## Why the Specific Techniques Were Used

### 1. **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**
   - **Why CNN?**
     CNNs are highly effective for image processing tasks due to their ability to automatically learn hierarchical features from raw pixel data. 
     - **Feature Extraction**: The early layers of a CNN automatically detect low-level features like edges, corners, and textures, while deeper layers learn more complex patterns.
     - **Spatial Invariance**: CNNs are good at learning spatial hierarchies, making them particularly useful for interpreting images.

   - **Why Used in This Project?**
     CNNs are used to extract visual features from the MNIST images (i.e., digits). Since we are working with images, CNNs can help capture the necessary spatial patterns, such as the shape of the digits, which are essential for recognition tasks.

### 2. **Bidirectional LSTM (Bi-LSTM)**
   - **Why LSTM?**
     LSTMs are a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) specifically designed to handle long-term dependencies in sequential data. They are capable of remembering information for long periods, which is crucial for tasks that require context or understanding over time, like handwriting.
     - **Bidirectional LSTM**: A Bi-LSTM processes the sequence in both forward and backward directions. This allows the network to consider both past and future context when predicting each output, which is helpful for sequences where the interpretation of one digit depends on both previous and future digits in the sequence.

   - **Why Used in This Project?**
     The LSTM is used as a sequence model to process the features extracted by the CNN. Since we're predicting multi-digit numbers (a sequence), the Bi-LSTM allows the model to capture temporal dependencies across the digits in the sequence, improving accuracy in recognizing the entire sequence of digits.

### 3. **Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) Loss**
   - **Why CTC Loss?**
     CTC loss is ideal for sequence-to-sequence tasks where the alignment between input and output is unknown. In the context of handwriting recognition, the number of digits in the sequence and their positions in the image may vary.
     - **Flexible Alignment**: CTC allows the model to predict sequences of different lengths without the need for precise alignment between input pixels and output digits. This is crucial when the number of digits in an image can vary, or when the image may contain noise or distortions.
     - **No Need for Segmentation**: CTC loss eliminates the need for explicit segmentation of the input sequence (i.e., separating individual digits), simplifying the problem.

   - **Why Used in This Project?**
     The MNIST dataset consists of images where each image contains a single digit, but we are stacking consecutive digits horizontally to form a multi-digit number. Since we do not know where one digit ends and another begins (the alignment is unknown), CTC loss is used to train the model effectively without explicit segmentation of the digits.

### 4. **Data Augmentation**
   - **Why Augment Data?**
     Data augmentation techniques, such as rotation, scaling, and shifting, artificially increase the diversity of the dataset. This helps the model generalize better by exposing it to different variations of the input data, which can prevent overfitting and improve performance on unseen data.

   - **Why Used in This Project?**
     The model is trained on a limited dataset of MNIST digits, so augmenting the data helps simulate real-world variations such as rotated or shifted digits. For multi-digit recognition, this is particularly important as digits might appear in different orientations, placements, and sizes in real-world images.

### 5. **Multi-Digit Sequence Generation**
   - **Why Stack Images?**
     The MNIST dataset contains single digits, but for this task, we need multi-digit sequences. By stacking consecutive MNIST images horizontally, we create synthetic multi-digit numbers.
     - **Why Use Sequence Input?**
       The model is designed to predict multi-digit numbers from stacked digit images, simulating how multi-digit numbers are written and scanned in real-world applications like automatic number plate recognition (ANPR) or optical character recognition (OCR).

   - **Why Used in This Project?**
     Stacking digits horizontally allows the model to learn how to read multi-digit numbers from a single image. By feeding stacked images into the model, we simulate real-world applications where sequences of digits are often written in a single line (e.g., credit card numbers or postal codes).
